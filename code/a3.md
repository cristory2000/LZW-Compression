## Writeup

When running all the compression algorithms I got many different compression ratios. For the code.txt file the only ratio that differed was the original LZW. It was worse at compressing and I imagine it is because it reads in strings instead of letters. This is similar to what happened in code2.txt where LZW was the worst. Since there were so many unique strings in the code it did not compress well when taking one string. When using the medium file the same occurrence happened where LZW was the worst and the rest stayed the same. However, for the large.txt the files LZW was by far the worst but LZWmod was the best. This is interesting because I thought LZWmod r would be better for bigger files. This is potentially because there were many similarities in the text where the codebook was very efficient without resetting. The winnit bmp file compressed very well except for LZW which grew in size. Since the file was a complex image reading in strings might have caused more codewords for each bitmap. The opposite happened with wacky.bmp. It compressed the best out of any file that I tested with ratios in the 200s. The compression algorithms were all the same except LZW which was the best. I believe this compressed so well because of the nature of the image. It was extremely simple and mainly contained whitespace. This did not need many codewords to be generated. Because of this the compressed file size was very small and by far the ratios. The lego-big.gif file had interesting results where every compress grew bigger except for compress.exe. I imagine this is something to do with the nature of gif. Which are created using lossy compression and therefore are not compressed well again. Compress.exe may not even compress because gifs are already smaller. The all.tar file compressed well with LZWmod R and the compress.exe. This is expected as LZWmod r is meant for large archive files. The assign2.doc compressed the same except for LZW which is a pattern. The bmps.tar file is another huge file which did the best with compres.exe, LZWmod R, and LZWmod which is similar to the other .tar file. LZWmod may have done well because it contains bitmaps. Edit.exe compressed the best with compres.exe but grew in growth with LZW. Since it contains machine code which varies greatly reading in strings may cause more harm than good. Frosty.jpg was similar to gif with everything growing LZW being the worst and compress.exe not running. Like .gif jpg is already compressed so it did not work well when trying to compress again and is likely the reason compress.exe did not work. This is exactly the same with the gone fishing image for the same reasons with the gif file. The last file texts.tar acted similarly for the other archives. Compress.exe was the best with LZWmod r very close and LZW being the worst.
